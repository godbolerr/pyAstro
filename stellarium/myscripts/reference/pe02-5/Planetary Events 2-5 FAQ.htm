****<P>
There are 3 versions each of the Mercury, Venus and Mars scripts. Small, Medium 
and Large. Each planet's scripts are identical except for the date range of the 
events. They all start with the year 2000 and all the large scripts ends at the year 3000. 
The smaller and medium in scripts end years earlier.<P>
The reason to have three is because Stellarium is a memory hog, and 
unfortunately on some computers, having a more events means a larger script file which 
can cause Stellarium 
to run bad and/or crash. 
<P>
For the Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune scripts, 
there's no reason to do this as their slower rotation around the sun means fewer 
events which equals a smaller file size.<P>
***********&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <P>
Conjunctions: The definition of conjunctions used in this script is 
Conjunctions are the closest approach two bodies come to each other. Another 
definition of Conjunction often is used is the time two bodies are at the same 
Right Ascension. So the time of a conjunction here might not match other 
sources.<P>
Conjunction cut off: For bright stars Aldebaran, Antares, Regulus, Spica, 
Pleiades I use 6.5° as the cut off for what's a conjunction or not, dimmer stars 
&amp; nebula I use 1°, the tiny crab nebula I use 0.1°&nbsp; 
<P>
I excluded all Mercury, Venus, Mars and star conjunctions where they are less than
12&#176; from the sun, If I included them there would be 3x as many conjunctions
and the script would be cluttered with conjunctions you wouldn't be able
to see anyhow.
<P>
***********
<P>
The Scripts will attempt to display the closest and best 
viewing time for the Latitude and Longitude. It mostly gets it right.<P>
The information shown for each event are for the time of the event. The Planet 
might be in a slightly different position when&nbsp;the event displays&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<P>
The Exceptions are transits of the sun by Mercury and Venus, the scripts will go 
to the exact time of the transit, even if it is below the horizon 
<P>
****<P>
Moon<P>
In version 2.4 Moon Conjunctions were added to the scripts<P>
Moon conjunctions don't go to the year 3000 yet. I calculated the conjunction 
times using Stellarium and it takes about 10 hours to calculate 100 years. As 
such I didn't complete them and the Conjunctions only go to years 2100 - 2200.<P>
&nbsp; Moon conjunction times and separation angle was calculated from Long 0 
and Lat 0 without the ground. Times and separation angles might be slightly 
different at other locations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<P>
&nbsp;<P>
Magnitudes: 
<P>
You would think this would be easy to calculate and there would be 
one simple universal way to calculate magnitudes of the planets. This is not 
true however and magnitude values vary from source to source.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example some 
sources claim Venus max brightness is -4.4 while others have it at -4.9 and 
everything in between. As such my calculations for the planets maybe slightly 
different than Stellarium (I don't know the numbers/calculations they use). For 
example where as in Stellarium Venus' brightest magnitudes are about -4.55 mine 
are about -4.85. Jupiter and Earth (though not the moon) also come out slightly 
different in my calculations. I base my calculations off&nbsp;the
<a href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi#top">JPL Horizons site </a>&nbsp;and my 
magnitudes seems to match theirs.<P>
The biggest difference of all though is Saturn, Stellarium doesn't factor ring tilt when 
calculating magnitude where my scripts do. So the more the rings are tilted the 
bigger the difference between my script and Stellarium.
Uranus' rings are too faint to have any effect on it's brightness as seen from 
earth.<P>
Mars' Magnitudes are also slightly different (Between .1 &amp; .2 Mag) from the 
script and Stellarium. As such Brilliancy milestones (i.e. Brightens to -1) are 
slightly different from Stellarium's numbers.<P>
Even though Magnitude numbers might be different, regardless of the number, 
greatest &amp; dimmest brilliancies dates are the same.<P>
*****<P>
Venus Cycles: Venus has 5 cycles that repeat every 8 years. Surprisingly no has 
named them. Being Venus is the Goddess of Love and &quot;Amore&quot; is Latin for love and 
has 5 letters, I called the cycle by each letter A-M-O-R-E. Each cycle begins at 
Superior Conjunction and the 1st &quot;A&quot; cycle was the cycle Venus was in 1/1/2000. 
<P>
Mercury has 3 cycles that repeat closely repeat every year. I named these 1-2-3. 
The 1st cycle was the cycle Mercury was in 1/1/2000. 
<P>
****<P>
Mars Opposition, Closest Approach and Greatest Brilliancy: 
<P>
You would think they 
would all be at the same time. But they are not, the date Mars makes it's 
closest approach to Earth is different from it's opposition date, this 
difference can be<font size="4"> ±</font> a couple of days to up to
<font size="4">±</font> a week. You would also think Mars' greatest Brilliancy 
would be during it's closest approach being closer = brighter.&nbsp; Not 
exactly, because during opposition Mars' phase is more fuller and fuller phase = 
brighter. So due to phase versus closeness, Mars' greatest brilliancy will occur 
between opposition and closest approach. Since phase changes have more of an 
effect (think Full Moon vs ½ Moon), Mars' greatest brilliancy will be closer to 
it's opposition date.<P>
Jupiter's opposition &amp; closest approach are about 1 day apart. Both are included 
in the script. Jupiter's Greatest Brilliancy is minutes/hours after opposition, 
but the magnitude difference between Opposition, Greatest Brilliancy &amp; Closest 
approach is so miniscule that it really wasn't worth it to include Greatest 
Brilliancy in the script.<P>
The other outer planets Opposition, Greatest Brilliancy and Closest Approach 
all occur within minutes of each other so there's little point in including all 
of them and only opposition is in the scripts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<P>
*****<p>Mars' Dimmest Brilliancy is not always near Superior conjunction or when 
Mars is furthest away from Earth. Due to a combo of phase and distance Mars' 
dimmest brilliancy can occur anytime when it is from 0° up to near 50° 
elongation from the sun.&nbsp; There's always a morning/western dimmest 
brilliancy, however sometimes there isn't a evening/eastern one, that is Mars 
will continue to dim right up to and through Superior conjunction and be at it's 
dimmest sometime on the morning/western side.&nbsp; </p>
<p>********</p>
<p>Mercury's Potential Best: <br><br>Unlike Venus &amp; Mars, Mercury's brightest 
magnitude is always near Superior Conjunction. This is because at Mercury's 
distance from Earth, what phase Mercury is in is pretty much the only factor in 
what magnitude is it. At Superior Conjunction it is 100% full while at Inferior 
Conjunction it is 0%, so after Superior Conjunction even though it gets closer &amp; 
closer to Earth, Mercury continually dims up to Inferior Conjunction and then 
likewise after Inferior Conjunction as Mercury gets farther &amp; farther it still 
continually brightens until Superior Conjunction.</p>
<p>This makes Mercury difficult to observe. When it is brightest, it's lost in 
the glare of the sun and when it is at it greatest elongation it is dim. So 
Mercury's potential best viewing time is when it is far enough to be out of the 
solar glare but close enough to be at a bright phase. </p>
<p>This time is subjective, but for the script I chose when Mercury is at 18° 
elongation on the far side of the sun. It phase is equivalent to a gibbous moon 
and at 18° when Mercury would be still up after Astronomical Twilight if it 
rides high in the Northern Hemisphere or runs low in the Southern Hemisphere&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>Transit: When the body crosses the meridian. </p>
<p>Elongation: The separation &nbsp;in degrees between the planet and sun. </p>
<p>RA Elongation: The Right Ascension separation between sun and body </p>
<p>Magnitude: The brightness of the planet. </p>
<p>Rides High / Runs Low: This is the declination difference between the sun and 
planet. When the planet rides high it is above the sun, runs low it is below. In 
the Northern Hemisphere when the planet (especially inferior ones) &quot;rides high&quot; 
it is more easily viewable and when it runs low even though it might have a 
large elongation from the sun it could be hard to view. In the Southern 
Hemisphere the opposite is true so &quot;runs low&quot; is better. </p>
<p>Ring Tilt: The tilt of Saturn's rings. Heliocentric is the tilt as seen from 
the sun. Geocentric is the tilt from the Earth.</p>
<p>Phase Angle: This is the angle from the planet to the sun and earth. Range is 
from °0 to 180°. If it's zero the planet appears &quot;full&quot;, if it's 90 degrees it 
appears &quot;half&quot;, and if it's 180 degrees it appears &quot;new&quot;. Only the Moon and 
Mercury and Venus can have phase angles exceeding about 50 degrees. 
Interestingly the phase angle is also the elongation from the sun the earth 
would be if you were on the planet. </p>
<p>Earth Shine: This is the phase the Earth would be if you were on the planet
</p>
<p>Earth Mag: This is the magnitude the Earth would if you were on the planet
</p>
<p>Moon Mag: This is the magnitude the moon would be if you were on the planet
</p>

<P>
There are two modes to select Key Press Mode and Screensaver Mode
<P>
Key press mode, the conjunction will display until you press one of the =
- [ ] keys
<P>
Screen Saver Mode&nbsp;the script will behave<B> LIKE</B> a screensaver.
<P>
Keyword LIKE, it doesn't work exactly like a screensaver,
<P>
When you select screensaver mode, up will pop the 1st conjunction, the program
will hold for 3 seconds (This is the default time, you can edit this time
in the script file if you wish) and then go to the next conjunction and again
hold for 3 seconds and then the next conjunction and on and on.
<P>
To leave the screen saver, unlike "real" screensavers pressing any key &nbsp;or
moving the mouse will not cause the screensaver to end, with these scripts
only changing the date by pressing the dates keys will cause the screensaver
to end.&nbsp;
<P>
*****************
<P>
All these scripts will start at the next up coming event.
<P>
For example with Mars Events script file<BR>
On 10/1/2015 it should start with the Antares - Mars conjunction on 10/20/2015<BR>
On 10/20/2015 it should still start with the conjunction on 10/20/2015<BR>
But on 10/21/2015 the program will then start with the Mars - Mercury 
conjunction on 11/6/2015
<P>
If you want to start on a different date, just adjust the date to where you
want to start&nbsp;in the main menu
<P>
****************
<p>&nbsp;These&nbsp; scripts were designed to be used with landscapes that have 
minimal obstructions on the horizon </p>
<P>
*****************
<P>
No I didn't type all these years and times out. I wrote a computer program
based on Paul Schlyter's work at
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html">http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html</A><BR>
<P>
which produced all these values.
<P>
*******************
<P>
My dates I calculated do seem to match other dates from a wide variety of
sources, but I make no guarantee on accuracy.
<P>
I'm sure accuracy decreases the further back or forward in time any given
script goes.
